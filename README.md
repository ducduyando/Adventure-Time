+ GAME NAME: Adventure Time
## **Description**
- The game is coded with the C++ and SDL3
- You will control the main character of the game - FINN, use his 3 abilities to defeat all the Skeletons in order to beat the game, but you will not know which abilities do they have, so you better remember them whenever you lose
- This RPG game focuses on countering enemies' abilities by learning how they work, calculating the mana point, making outstanding strategy with them, but remember that the Skeletons also have abilities to counter you too!
- The game is based on a removed nostalgic game which I have played when I was a child but remade with different concepts, characters from Adventure Time an OG cartoon series, pixel art styles and 8-bit, retro arcade soundtracks and sfx
