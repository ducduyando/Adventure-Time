+ GAME NAME: Adventure Time
## **Description**
- The game is coded with the C++ and SDL3
- You will control the main character of the game - FINN, use his 3 abilities to defeat all the Skeletons in order to beat the game, but you will not know which abilities do they have, so you better remember them whenever you lose
- This RPG game focuses on countering enemies' abilities by learning how it works, calculating the mana point, make outstanding strategy with them, and remember the Skeletons also have the ability to counter you too!
- The game is based on a removed nostalgic game I have played when I was a child but remaked with different concepts, characters, pixel art style and 8-bit, retro arcade soundtracks and sfx
